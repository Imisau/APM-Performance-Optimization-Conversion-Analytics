### Emerging Markets | Power BI (3 Pages) | Excel-Based Analysis

# 🚀 Project Context
This project simulates the role of a hands-on APM Analyst supporting the Head of Alternative Payment Methods.
Using:
-	A transaction-level Excel dataset
-	Power BI dashboards
- analyzed APM adoption, conversion efficiency, and execution bottlenecks across emerging markets, translating performance data into clear recommendations that support APM strategy, integrations, launches, and optimization initiatives.

# 📂 Data Overview (Excel Analysis)
### Dataset Characteristics
-	Transaction-level APM performance data
-	Multiple emerging markets
-	Multiple payment methods (Cards, Wallets, USSD, Bank Transfer, etc.)

### Key Metrics
-	Transactions attempted
-	Authorized transactions
-	Completed transactions
-	Transaction value
-	Failure outcomes
-	Market and payment method dimensions

### Overall Funnel Performance (Excel-Derived)
|Metric	                     |Value
:---------------------------:|:---------------------|
Total Transactions	         |10,000
Authorization Rate	         |~78%
Completion Rate	             |~71%
Post-Authorization Drop-off	 |~7%
Avg Transaction Value	       |~$150

### Analytical Signal:
Customers are largely able and willing to pay, but a meaningful share of transactions fail after authorization, pointing to execution and flow inefficiencies rather than payment trust issues.

**Insight:** Revenue Leakage Occurs After Authorization
![](https://github.com/Imisau/APM-Performance-Optimization-Conversion-Analytics/blob/main/AMP_PerOpt3.png)

## What the data shows:
-	Strong authorization performance
-	Noticeable drop between authorized and completed transactions
-	Stable transaction values

## Interpretation:
Authorization is not the limiting factor. Revenue loss occurs after customer commitment, suggesting issues such as confirmation failures, timeout risks, or redirect friction.

### Implication for APM Strategy:
This represents the fastest conversion uplift opportunity, as it does not require new markets or payment methods.

**Insight:** Alternative Payment Methods Perform on Par with Cards

## What the data shows:
-	Wallets, USSD, and bank-based APMs show authorization rates comparable to cards
-	Completion rates follow a uniform pattern across all methods
-	Transaction values are consistent regardless of payment type

## Interpretation:
APMs are not underperforming due to lack of customer trust or low usage quality. Performance gaps are systemic and shared across methods.

### Implication for APM Strategy:
This validates continued investment in local APMs, especially in low-card-penetration markets.

**Insight:** Markets Are Ready, Execution Quality Varies

## What the data shows:
-	Some markets exhibit high authorization but lower completion
-	Failures cluster around technical and process-related issues
-	No single market or payment method dominates failures

## Interpretation:
Markets are structurally ready for APM usage, but conversion outcomes depend on local execution quality, partner performance, and flow reliability.

### Implication for APM Strategy:
Lower-performing markets should be treated as optimization opportunities, not deprioritized regions.

# 💡 Key Recommendations (Action-Oriented)

## ✅ 1️⃣ Prioritize Post-Authorization Flow Optimization

-	Focus on confirmation steps, timeout handling, and redirect stability
-	Even a 1–2% completion uplift translates into material revenue recovery at scale

### Recommendation:
Initiate a cross-functional review with Product and Engineering to identify friction points after authorization.

## ✅ 2️⃣ Treat USSD & Wallets as Core Strategic APMs

-	Strong authorization confirms user trust
-	Performance issues mirror cards, indicating platform-level constraints

### Recommendation:
Maintain APM parity in optimization roadmaps rather than prioritizing cards over alternative method.

## ✅ 3️⃣ Apply Market-Specific Execution Improvements
-	Address latency, partner response timing, and integration robustness in lower-completion markets

### Recommendation:
Deploy targeted market-level diagnostics instead of global one-size-fits-all fixes.

## ✅ 4️⃣ Reframe APM Optimization as Revenue Protection
-	Avg transaction ≈ $150
-	Completion losses represent recoverable revenue, not just operational noise

### Recommendation:
Position APM improvements internally as direct revenue-impact initiatives, not purely technical enhancements.

# 📌 Conclusion
This analysis demonstrates that APM performance across emerging markets is fundamentally strong, with customer trust already established at the authorization stage.
The primary limitation to growth is not adoption or payment method viability, but execution efficiency after authorization.
By focusing on post-authorization optimization, systemic flow improvements, and targeted market-level fixes, dLocal can unlock immediate revenue recovery while strengthening the scalability of its APM platform.
This is the type of data-driven, execution-focused insight required to scale Alternative Payment Methods sustainably in emerging markets.
